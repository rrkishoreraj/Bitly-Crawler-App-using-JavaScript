# Bitly Crawler App using JavaScript
-------------------------------------

Read - http://bit.ly/fetchAPIJavaScript


A web application built using JavaScript to fetch the **URLs** from the specific user's **Bitly account**.

---
### Inspired by ["Elm for Bitly"](https://bitly-elm.glitch.me/) - App built using **'Elm script'**, and recreated  with **'JavaScript'** version
---

## What does this app do?

  The app gets the input choice from the user and performs **'AJAX request'** (implemented along with **'_`promise`_'**) to respective server and fetches   the URLs from it.  
  
  After the URLs are been fetched, the required URLs ( **needle** ) can be searched and filtered from the list   of displayed URLs ( **hay** )
  
  ---
  
  ### Reason:
  * To make use of an API and understand how the APIs can be used to get information from different resources.
  * To understand how **'Bitly API'** can be used to fetch various information from the particular user's         Bitly account.
