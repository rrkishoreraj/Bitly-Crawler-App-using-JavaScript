# Bitly Crawler App using JavaScript
-------------------------------------



A web application built using JavaScript to fetch the **URLs** from the specific user's **Bitly account**.

---
### Inspired by ["Elm for Bitly"](https://bitly-elm.glitch.me/) - App built using **'Elm script'**, and recreated  with **'JavaScript'** version
---

## Current version of this app:

  The app currently fetches URLs from the two files from the server
  * links.json
  * test-file.json

  The **links.json** file contains **35 links** and the **test-file.json** file contains **5005 links**. 

  The links (URLs) in **testfile.json** is created by simply pasting the links from the **links.json** file for about **143 times** ( 143 x 35 = 5005 links ).

  The links in the above two **json files** are fetched by making an **AJAX Call** to the required JSON file using the **'GET'** request.

  After the URLs are fetched, we can now search for the required URL.
 
 
## Upcoming version of this app:

* To fetch URLs from the bitly account by using **bitly API**.
* Any users can fetch the URLs from their bitly account by authenticating  their account using the **access token**.
